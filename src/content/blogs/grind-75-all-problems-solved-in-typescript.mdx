## All Problems

All the problems in the [Grind 75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75/?weeks=18&hours=9&order=topics) list solved in TypeScript.

| LC #  | Problem | Difficulty | Topic |
| ----- | ------- | ---------- | ----- |
| 1     | [Two Sum](#two-sum) | *Easy* | Array |
| 121   | [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](#best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock) | *Easy* | Array |
| 57    | [Insert Interval](#insert-interval) | *Medium* | Array |

## [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
**Problem Statement**: 
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.
<br/>
**Code**:
```typescript
function twoSum(nums: number[], target: number): number[] {
    const map = new Map<number, number>();
    for(let i=0; i<nums.length; i++){
        const reqd = target - nums[i];
        if(map.has(reqd)){
           return [map.get(reqd), i]; 
        } map.set(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new Array<number>();
};
```

**Time Complexity:** `O(n)` - We traverse the list containing `n` elements. 

**Space Complexity:** `O(n)` - We store the indices of all the elements in a map.

## [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)
**Problem Statement**:
You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i`th day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing **a different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.
<br/>
**Code**:
```typescript
function maxProfit(prices: number[]): number {
    let buyIndex = 0;
    let maxProfit = 0;
    for(let i=1; i<prices.length; i++){
        if(prices[i] < prices[buyIndex]){
            buyIndex = i;
        } else if(prices[i] > prices[buyIndex]){
            const currentProfit = prices[i] - prices[buyIndex];
            maxProfit = Math.max(currentProfit, maxProfit);
        }
    }
    return maxProfit;
};
```
**Time Complexity:** `O(n)` - We traverse through the array containing `n` elements.

**Space Complexity:** `O(1)` - We are using only a constant amount of space, as we only store a few variables regardless of the input size.
